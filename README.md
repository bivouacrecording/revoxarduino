Revox Arduino Instrument
Hello!
This is the code that controls 4 Revox A77 reel to reel tape recorders with MIDI note on and off messages.
This code is used with 4 aruduino NANO in a custom made 1U rack mounted unit.
There are more details coming about it soon on my website so if there is not a weblink here then you have come too early. Check out my website for more info about the instrument and about our other projects.

Thanks!
