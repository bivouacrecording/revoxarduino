Revox Arduino Instrument
Hello!
This is the code that controls 4 Revox A77 reel to reel tape recorders with MIDI note on and off messages.
This code is used with 4 aruduino NANO in a custom made 1U rack mounted unit.
There are more details coming about it soon on my website so if there is not a weblink here then you have come too early. Check out my website for more info about the instrument and about our other projects.

The code is not the best or the most complicated. I am a novice at best but it works the way I want it to and that's good enough for me. Feel free to make it more streamlined for your application.

Here are the MIDI notes per the file:
